Let's break down what you've provided and see what we can do to get you what you need.

**Understanding Your Request**

It looks like you're working with code snippets and trying to extract information or complete tasks related to:

* **"Scripting"**:  You're likely using a scripting language like Python, JavaScript, or Bash.
* **Code Examples**: You've provided snippets of code that seem to be from different languages and contexts.
* **Code Completion**: You're asking me to help complete or understand parts of the code.
* **Software Development Concepts**:  Terms like "automation," "handling," "implementation," and "onboarding" suggest you're interested in how software is built and how it interacts with data. 

**How I Can Help**

To give you the best assistance, please provide me with more context:

1. **Specific Languages**: Which programming languages are you primarily working with (e.g., Python, JavaScript, bash)?
2. **Code Goals**: What exactly are you trying to achieve with each code snippet? What is the purpose of the code?
3. **Specific Problems**:  Point out the exact parts of the code where you're stuck or need help understanding.
4. **Desired Output**: What do you expect the completed code or the output of the code to be?

**Example**

Let's say you have this Python code snippet:

```python
def greet(name):
  print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice") 
```

And you want to know what it does. You could ask:

"I have this Python code. What does it do, and how does it work?"
