# ðŸŒ… 7AM Test: From Beginner to PRO

##  Playwright Automation for ADP: A Practical Lesson for Automation Architects

**1. Learning Objective:**

Today, you'll learn how to use Playwright to automate repetitive tasks within ADP's RUN system, focusing on employee onboarding and payroll processes. You'll gain practical experience with element locators, DOM manipulation, and handling shadow-DOM elements, essential for robust automation.

**2. Real-World Scenario:**

Imagine you're tasked with automating the onboarding process for new hires at your company. This involves creating new employee accounts, filling in personal information, and linking payroll details within ADP's RUN system. 

**3. Code Implementation:**

```javascript
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

async function automateOnboarding() {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  await page.goto('https://your-adp-run-url'); // Replace with your actual ADP URL

  // Login to ADP
  await page.type('#usernameInput', 'your_adp_username');
  await page.type('#passwordInput', 'your_adp_password');
  await page.click('#loginButton');

  // Navigate to onboarding section
  await page.click('//a[contains(text(), "Onboarding")]'); 

  // Locate and fill in employee details
  await page.type('#employeeNameInput', 'John Doe');
  await page.type('#employeeEmailInput', 'john.doe@example.com');
  // ... fill in other details

  // Handle shadow-DOM elements (example)
  const shadowRoot = await page.evaluate(() => {
    return document.querySelector('my-custom-element').shadowRoot; 
  });
  await shadowRoot.querySelector('#payrollDetailsInput').type('1234567890');

  // Submit the onboarding form
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');

  await browser.close();
}

automateOnboarding();
```

**4. Step-by-Step Execution:**

1. **Install dependencies:** `npm install playwright`
2. **Replace placeholders:**  Update the code with your actual ADP URL, username, password, and element selectors.

3. **Run the script:** `node automateOnboarding.js`

**5. Pro Tips:**

* **Locating elements:** Use a combination of `id`, `class`, `xpath`, and `innerText` for robust element selection even if element structures change.
* **Shadow DOM:** Utilize `page.evaluate()` to access shadow DOM elements and manipulate their properties.
* **Error Handling:** Incorporate `try...catch` blocks to gracefully handle unexpected errors during automation.
* **Wait Strategies:** Playwright offers various wait strategies to ensure elements are loaded and ready before interaction.
* **Data-Driven Testing:** Introduce data files to parameterize your automation for testing different scenarios and inputs.

**6. Practice Challenge:**

* **Payroll Automation:** Write a script to automate common payroll tasks like viewing pay stubs, exporting payroll reports, or submitting timesheets.
* **Client Management:**  Automate tasks like adding new client details, managing contract renewals, or generating client invoices within ADP's client management module.

**7. Next Steps:**

* **Explore Playwright's API:** Deep dive into the Playwright documentation to discover more advanced features and functionalities. 
* **Parallel Testing:** Explore running multiple scenarios concurrently to improve test coverage and execution speed.
* **Integration with CI/CD:** Integrate your Playwright tests into your CI/CD pipeline for continuous testing and automation.
