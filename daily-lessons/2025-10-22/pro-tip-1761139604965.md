: It seems like you're trying to use some programming concepts and terms in a way that doesn't quite make sense. Let's break down what you've written and try to understand what you're aiming for. 

You're mixing elements from:

* **Programming Languages:** You've mentioned "javascript", "python", "code", "function", "learning", "automation", and "run", which are all related to programming.
* **Testing Frameworks:** "Jest", "Selenium", "Cypress", "Playwright", and "Cucumber" are testing frameworks used to automate interactions with websites and applications. These frameworks often involve writing code.
* **Software Development Concepts:** "API", "automation", "documentation", "permissions", and "deployment" are general software development concepts.

**To help me understand your needs better, can you please clarify:**

* **What are you trying to achieve?** Are you trying to write code to automate a task, test a website, or something else entirely?
* **What specific problem are you facing?**  
* **What programming languages or frameworks are you familiar with?**
* **Can you provide any more context or examples?**

The more information you give me, the better I can understand your request and offer helpful advice.
