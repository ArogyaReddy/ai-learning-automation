It seems like you're building an idea for a system that helps manage "technical interviews," but your request is a bit fragmented. To help me understand and assist you better, please provide:

* **Specifically, what kind of technical interviews?**  
    * Software engineering? 
    * Data science?
    * Design?
    * Something else?
* **What are the key features of your ideal system?**  
    *  Scheduling?
    *  Coding assessments?
    *  Automated feedback?
    *  Candidate tracking?
* **What is your target audience for this system?** 
    *  Hiring managers?
    *  Candidates? 
    *  Both?

Once you provide more context, I can give you more helpful advice and potentially even brainstorm some specific features or functionalities!
