##  ADP RUN Automation with JavaScript and Playwright  

###  Learning Objective:

Master the fundamentals of automating ADP RUN processes using JavaScript and Playwright.  


### Real-World Scenario:

Imagine you're automating employee onboarding into ADP RUN.  You need to:

1. **Navigate** to the ADP RUN login page.
2. **Enter** valid username & password to log in.
3. **Click** on the "New Hire" button.
4. **Fill** in the required employee information (Name, Address, Social Security Number).
5. **Select** appropriate deductions and benefits.
6. **Submit** the onboarding form.


### Code Implementation:

```javascript
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

async function automateOnboarding(username, password) {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  
  // Navigation (Assumptions: You need to replace these with actual ADP RUN URLs
  // and exact button selectors)
  await page.goto('https://www.adp.com/run');
  await page.fill('input[name="username"]', username);
  await page.fill('input[name="password"]', password);
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');

  // New Hire button Locator (Replace with the actual locator)
  await page.click('button[id="newHireButton"]'); 

  // Fill in employee details and submit
  await page.fill('input[name="employeeName"]', 'John Doe'); 

  // ... (Repeat for other fields: address, SSN, deductions, benefits) ...

  // Submit Button Locator (Replace with the actual locator)
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');

  await browser.close();
}

automateOnboarding('your_username', 'your_password');
```

### Step-by-Step Execution:

1.  **Install Playwright:** `npm install playwright`
2. **Choose a browser:** Replace `chromium` with `firefox` or `webkit` in the code.
3. **Update Locators:** You MUST find the **exact** HTML `id`s, `name`s, or CSS selectors for the elements on ADP RUN. Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the elements.
4. **Replace Placeholders:** Put your actual username, password, and employee details into the code.
5. **Run:** `node your_script.js`

### Pro Tips:

* **Shadow DOM:** ADP RUN and many web apps use Shadow DOM. Some browsers have mechanisms for accessing it (e.g., `page.waitForSelector(selector, { shadow: true })`). Research how to target elements within Shadow DOM.
* **WebElementEntity:** Consider using a tool like Playwright's built-in `page.locator` or `page.waitForSelector` to ensure robustness against minor UI changes.
* **Object Repository:**  Organize your locators into an external file (e.g., `locators.js`) to make your code maintainable.
* **Data-Driven Testing:** Use a data file or array to automate multiple onboarding scenarios with different employee details.


### Practice Challenge:

1. **Locate and Click:** Can you find the "Pay Settings" button on ADP RUN using Playwright?
2. **Select a Value:** Can you choose a specific benefit option (e.g., "Healthcare Plan") from a dropdown list?

### Next Steps:

* Explore more complex interactions: Handling dynamic data, attaching file uploads, verifying success messages.
* Learn about Playwright's testing API for creating end-to-end tests.
* Research how to integrate Playwright with your CI/CD pipeline for continuous testing.
