## Automation Architect Lesson: Automating ADP RUN Onboarding with Playwright 

**Objective:** 

Today, you'll learn to leverage Playwright to automate the ADP RUN Onboarding process, focusing on basic navigation, data entry, and understanding DOM manipulation for handling dynamic elements.

**Scenario:**

Imagine you need to automate the onboarding process for new employees within ADP RUN. Specifically, you want to automate the following steps:

1.  Log in to ADP RUN.
2.  Navigate to the "Onboarding" section.
3.  Fill out the employee information form (name, address, etc.).
4.  Submit the form.

**Code Implementation**

```typescript
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

async function automateOnboarding() {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  // Navigate to ADP RUN login page
  await page.goto('https://your-adp-run-login-url');

  // Fill in login credentials
  await page.fill('#username', 'your_username');
  await page.fill('#password', 'your_password');
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');

  // Navigate to Onboarding section
  await page.goto('https://your-adp-run-onboarding-url');

  // Fill out employee information form 
  await page.fill('input[name="name"]', 'John Doe');
  // ... fill other fields ...

  // Submit the form
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');

  await browser.close();
}

automateOnboarding();
```

**Step-by-Step Execution:**

1. Install Playwright: `npm install playwright`.
2. Replace placeholders (`your-adp-run-login-url`, etc.) with your actual ADP RUN URLs and credentials.
3. Run the TypeScript script: `node automateOnboarding.ts`.

**Pro Tips**

- **DOM Manipulation:**  ADP RUN, like most modern web applications, utilizes JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular, which can lead to dynamic DOM structures. Utilize browser dev tools to inspect elements and discover their corresponding selectors.  
- **Shadow DOM:** ADP RUN might use Shadow DOM for encapsulating components. In these cases, you might need to utilize Playwright's `shadowRoot()` method to interact with elements within the Shadow DOM.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling using try-catch blocks to gracefully handle unexpected scenarios during automation.
- **Asynchronous Programming:** Be mindful of Playwright's asynchronous nature.  Use `await` patiently to ensure actions are completed before proceeding.

**Practice Challenge**

1. Modify the code to capture and print an error message if the login fails. 
2. Automate the selection of a "Job Title" from a dropdown menu.
3. Autofill a date picker field with a specific date.

**Next Steps**

*  Deep dive into Playwright's API for advanced functionalities like:
    *   Data assertions: Validate data on web pages.
    *   Screenshots and video recording: Document automation runs for debugging or reporting.
    *   WebSockets: Interact with real-time applications.
