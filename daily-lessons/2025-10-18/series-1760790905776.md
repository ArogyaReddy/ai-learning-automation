## Playwright Automation Lesson: Automating Employee Onboarding Workflow

**Learning Objective:**  Master the use of Playwright and TypeScript to automate a specific employee onboarding workflow within ADP RUN Onboarding, focusing on shadow DOM navigation and element interaction.

**Real-World Scenario:**

Imagine a scenario where a new employee's information needs to be added to ADP RUN Onboarding. Our automation script will simulate the user journey, filling out necessary fields, signing documents digitally, and confirming account creation. 

**Code Implementation:**

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import { chromium } from '@playwright/test';

// Example: Automating Employee Information Input

test('Automates Employee Information Input', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://faux-adp-onboarding.com'); // Replace with actual URL

  // Example: Locators within Shadow DOM
  const nameInput = await page.locator('shadow::div[role="main"] button:has-text("Add Employee")'); 
  await nameInput.click();

  const firstNameInput = await page.locator('input[name="firstName"]');
  await firstNameInput.type('John');

  const lastNameInput = await page.locator('input[name="lastName"]');
  await lastNameInput.type('Doe');

  // ... Add more fields for other employee information ... 

  // Example: Handling Dynamically Generated Content
  const selectedRole = await page.locator('select[name="role"]');
  await selectedRole.selectOption('HR');
});
```

**Step-by-Step Execution:**

1.  **Install Playwright:** `npm install playwright`
2.  **Run the code:** `npx playwright test`
3.  **Observe Results:** Pay attention to the browser output and the console logs from Playwright.

**Pro Tips:**

* **Contextual Selectors:** Use selectors that are specific to the current context within the Shadow DOM. 
* **Selectors within Selectors:** Combine selectors to pinpoint specific elements within nested structures.
* **Dynamic Element Handling:** Implement strategies like waiting for specific conditions (e.g., element visibility) or using attributes to locate elements that change dynamically.

**Practice Challenge:**

Automate the process of selecting a pre-populated document within ADP RUN Onboarding and simulating a digital signature.

**Next Steps:**

* **Learn about Playwright's Test API:** Dive deeper into testing strategies, assertions, and advanced features.
* **Explore Page Object Model:**  Structure your automation code for better reusability and maintainability.
* **Integration with APIs:**  Connect your automation scripts with ADP APIs for data retrieval and manipulation.
