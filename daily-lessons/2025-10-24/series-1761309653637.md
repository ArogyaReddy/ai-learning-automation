##  Playwright Automation for ADP Onboarding: Navigating the Employee Profile

### Learning Objective 

Today, you will learn to automate the process of navigating an employee profile within an ADP onboarding application using Playwright, JavaScript, and TypeScript. You will gain experience with element locators, DOM manipulation, and handling shadow DOMs, all crucial for successfully automating complex web applications.

### Real-World Scenario

Imagine you're automating the onboarding process for a new employee. This script would navigate to the employee's profile, verify their personal information (name, address, contact details), and optionally update certain fields if necessary.

### Code Implementation

```javascript
const {chromium} = require('playwright');

async function automateADPOnboarding() {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://www.adp.com/login'); // Replace with actual ADP Onboarding URL

  // Login Credentials - Replace with actual values
  await page.type('input[name="username"]', 'YOUR_USERNAME');
  await page.type('input[name="password"]', 'YOUR_PASSWORD');
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');

  // Navigate to employee profile
  await page.waitForSelector('a[href*="employee-profile"]', { timeout: 60000 })
  await page.click('a[href*="employee-profile"]');

  // Retrieve and display employee information
  const nameElement = page.locator('h1[data-test-id="employee-name"]');
  const name = await nameElement.textContent();
  console.log(`Employee Name: ${name}`);

  // Example: Update employee address
  const addressInput = page.locator('input[name="address"]');
  await addressInput.fill('New Employee Address');
  await page.waitForTimeout(2000); // Allow time for update to reflect

  await browser.close();
}

automateADPOnboarding();
```

### Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Install Playwright:** `npm install playwright`
2. **Install Chromium Browser:**  Ensure you have a recent version of Chromium installed (Playwright uses Chromium's engine).
3. **Replace Placeholders:** Replace `YOUR_USERNAME`, `YOUR_PASSWORD`, and the ADP Onboarding URL with your actual values.
4. **Run Script:** `node your-script-name.js`


### Pro Tips

* **Robust Locator Strategies:** Combine multiple locator strategies (ID, class name, text content, XPath) for more resilient scripts. Consider using Playwright's `page.locator()` function for efficient and robust element selection.
* **Shadow DOM Handling:**  ADP might use shadow DOM to structure elements. Utilize Playwright's `shadow()` method to navigate and interact with elements within shadow DOMs.
* **Data-driven Testing:**  Replace manual data with variables or data files to easily test different scenarios and employee profiles.

* **Visual Testing:** Integrate visual regression testing tools like Percy with Playwright to ensure UI consistency across different automation runs.

### Practice Challenge

Modify the script to:

1. Verify the employee's email address displayed on their profile.
2. Click on a specific tab within the employee profile (e.g., "Personal Information", "Employment History"). 


### Next Steps


Explore these advanced concepts for more sophisticated ADP automation:

* **API Integration:** Automate tasks beyond webpage interactions by interacting with ADP's APIs.
* **Form Fill Automation:**  Learn to automatically fill out complex forms within the ADP Onboarding system.
* **Data Scraping:** Extract specific information from ADP pages for reporting or analysis.
