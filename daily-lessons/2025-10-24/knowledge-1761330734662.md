##  Lesson: Automating Client Onboarding with Playwright & TypeScript

**Learning Objective:**  

* Understand how to leverage Playwright and TypeScript for automating repetitive client onboarding workflows within ADP applications like ADP RUN Onboarding.

**Real-World Scenario:** Imagine you're an automation architect tasked with streamlining the client onboarding process within ADP RUN Onboarding. This process involves multiple steps:

1.  Navigating to the onboarding portal.
2.  Filling out client information forms (company details, contact info, etc.).
3.  Uploading required documents (tax forms, licenses).
4.  Reviewing and submitting the application.

Manually handling this for each new client is time-consuming and prone to errors.  

**Code Implementation:**

```typescript
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

async function autoOnboarding() {
    const browser = await chromium.launch();
    const page = await browser.newPage();

    // Navigate to ADP RUN Onboarding
    await page.goto('https://www.adp.com/run-onboarding'); 

    // Locate and fill client information fields 
    await page.type('#companyNameInput', 'Acme Corp');
    await page.type('#contactNameInput', 'John Smith');
    await page.type('#emailInput', 'john.smith@acme.com');

    // Handle document upload 
    await page.setInputFiles('#documentUpload', ['./documents/tax_form.pdf']);

    // Locate and click submit button
    await page.locator('button[type="submit"]').click();

    // Handle confirmation or error messages
    // ...

    await browser.close();
}

autoOnboarding();
```

**Step-by-Step Execution:**

1.  **Install Dependencies:** `npm install playwright`
2.  **Run the Script:** `node autoOnboarding.ts`

**Pro Tips for ADP/Payroll Systems Automation:**

* **Shadow DOM Handling:** ADP applications often utilize Shadow DOM.  Utilize Playwright's `locator` functions with appropriate strategies (e.g.,`xpath`, `css`, `textContent`) to  navigate and manipulate elements within the shadow DOM.
* **Dynamic Element IDs:** ADP forms may use dynamically generated IDs. Leverage Playwright's `waitForSelector`  to handle elements that appear after page load or script execution.
* **Data Input Strategies:**
    * **Playwright selectors:**  `#elementId`, `css:input[name="fieldName"]`, `text: "Button Text"`.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle unexpected scenarios during the automation process.

**Practice Challenge:**

1.  Modify the code to automate the submission of multiple clients.
2.  Implement data-driven testing by reading client information from a CSV file.
3.  Automate payroll settings configuration within ADP RUN.

**Next Steps:**

* **Explore Playwright's API:**  Dive deeper into Playwright's capabilities for advanced interactions (drag-and-drop, network interception, etc.).
* **Cucumber Integration:**  Combine Playwright with Cucumber for feature-driven automation and improved test documentation. 
* **Integrate with CI/CD:**  Set up continuous integration and deployment pipelines to run your ADP automation scripts regularly.
