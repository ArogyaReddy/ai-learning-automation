.  ##  Automating ADP RUN Onboarding with Playwright 

### 1. Learning Objective

Today, we'll learn how to automate the employee onboarding process using Playwright, focusing on ADP RUN's UI. 

### 2. Real-World Scenario

Imagine you have a new employee, John, who needs to be added to ADP RUN.  Instead of manually navigating the ADP RUN system and filling out forms, we can write a script to automate this process. This will save time and reduce the chances of human error.

### 3. Code Implementation

```javascript
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

async function automateOnboarding(employeeData) {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  try {
    // Navigate to ADP RUN Onboarding
    await page.goto('https://your_adp_run_onboarding_url'); 

    // Login (replace with your actual login credentials)
    await page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'Username' }).type('your_username');
    await page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'Password' }).type('your_password');
    await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Login' }).click();

    // Fill out employee information
    await page.getByLabel('First Name').type(employeeData.firstName);
    await page.getByLabel('Last Name').type(employeeData.lastName);
    // ... fill out other fields

    // Submit the onboarding form
    await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' }).click();

    console.log('Employee onboarding successful for:', employeeData.firstName, employeeData.lastName);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error during onboarding:', error);
  } finally {
    await browser.close();
  }
}

// Example usage
const employeeData = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  // ... other employee information
};

automateOnboarding(employeeData);


```

### 4. Step-by-Step Execution

1. Install Playwright: `npm install playwright`
2. Run `npx playwright install` to download the browser drivers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
3. Create a new file, paste the code, and save it as `onboarding.js`.
4. Replace the placeholders with your actual ADP RUN URL, login credentials, and employee data.
5. Run the script: `node onboarding.js`

### 5. Pro Tips

* Use Playwright's `locator` API to identify unique elements on the page, like using a specific field label or ID. 
* For dynamic content, leverage Playwright's robust selector options like `innerText`, `textContent` , or `contains` to select elements based on their content.
*  Understand the ADP RUN interface and its structure. 

### 6. Practice Challenge

* Automate the process of requesting time off in ADP RUN.
*  Automate the process of creating a new employee profile in ADP RUN.

### 7. Next Steps

* Explore Playwright's API for advanced features like:
    * **Screenshots:** Capture screenshots of specific elements or the entire page at different stages of the automation.
    * **Video recording:** Record the entire automation process as a video.
    * **Network monitoring:** Inspect the network requests made by your automation script to analyze its behaviour.
* Consider scheduling the automation to run periodically.
*  Research best practices for secure automation.



Remember, this is a simplified example. In a real-world scenario, you'll need to adapt the code based on the specific needs and structure of your ADP RUN instance.
