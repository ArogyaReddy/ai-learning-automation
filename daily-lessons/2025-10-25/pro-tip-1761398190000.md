## Lesson: Automating ADP Onboarding with Playwright

**Learning Objective:** Today, you'll learn how to automate the employee onboarding process using Playwright, focusing on interacting with ADP's web platform, specifically for tasks like inputting employee data and verifying completion.

**Real-World Scenario:** Imagine you're automating the onboarding process for new hires at a company.  Your tasks include:

*   Accessing the ADP RUN Onboarding portal.
*   Filling out employee information like name, address, and tax details.
*   Uploading required documents like proof of identity and emergency contact information.
*   Verifying that the onboarding process is completed successfully.

This automation will save time, reduce human error, and ensure consistent onboarding experiences for all new employees.


**Code Implementation:**


```javascript
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

async function automateOnboarding(username, password) {
  const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false });
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  // Navigate to the ADP RUN Onboarding portal
  await page.goto('https://your-adp-onboarding-url');

  // Login
  await page.type('#username', username);
  await page.type('#password', password);
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');

  // Fill out employee information
  await page.fill('#employeeName', 'John Doe');
  await page.fill('#address', '123 Main St');
  // ... fill in other fields

  // Upload documents
  const uploadButton = await page.locator('button[data-test="upload-documents"]');
  await uploadButton.click();
  await page.setInputFiles('input[type="file"]', ['path/to/document1.pdf', 'path/to/document2.jpg']);

  // Verify onboarding completion
  const completionMessage = await page.locator('div[data-test="onboarding-complete"]').textContent();
  console.log(completionMessage);

  // Close the browser
  await browser.close();
}

// Example usage
automateOnboarding('your-username', 'your-password');
```

**Step-by-Step Execution:**

1.  **Install dependencies:** Install Playwright using `npm install playwright`.
2.  **Modify code:** Update `your-adp-onboarding-url`, `your-username`, and `your-password` with your actual ADP credentials.
3.  **Run the script:** Execute the JavaScript file using Node.js: `node yourfilename.js`.



 **Pro Tips:**

*   **Shadow DOM Handling:** If ADP utilizes Shadow DOM, you'll need to delve into more advanced Playwright selectors like `page.locator('shadow::* input')` to target elements within the shadow DOM.
*   **Element State Checks:** Before proceeding, use assertions to verify that elements are in the expected state (e.g., visible, enabled) before interacting with them.
*   **Page Object Model:** For larger projects, consider implementing a Page Object Model to organize your locators and interactions for each page of the ADP onboarding flow.

**Practice Challenge:**

Modify the previous code to automate the process of selecting a job position from a dropdown menu during onboarding.

**Next Steps:**

Tomorrow's lesson will focus on:

*   **Handling Dynamic Content:** Learn how to deal with elements that load asynchronously using Playwright's promises and waiting mechanisms.
*   **Advanced Browser Interactions:** Explore more complex interactions like hover, scroll, and right-clicking.
