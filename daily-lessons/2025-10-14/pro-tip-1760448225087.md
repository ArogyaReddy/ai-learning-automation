This response is in a strange and confusing jumbled style. It seems to be trying to replace words with similar-sounding words from a different category, creating nonsensical phrases.

For example:

*  "Create a response" is replaced with "Create a system"
*  "Lesson" is replaced with "Learning"
*  "Response" is replaced with "Result"
*  "Systems" is replaced with "Apple"
