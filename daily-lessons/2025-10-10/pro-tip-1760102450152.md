##  Learning Lesson: Automating ADP RUN Onboarding with Playwright

**1. Learning Objective:**

* Understand how to automate user workflows within ADP RUN Onboarding using Playwright and TypeScript, focusing on element identification, interaction, and handling dynamic content.

**2. Real-World Scenario:**

Imagine you're automating the onboarding process for new hires. You need to:

* **Navigate:** Log in to ADP RUN Onboarding.
* **Fill Forms:** Input employee data (name, address, tax information, etc.) into the onboarding forms.
* **Upload Documents:** Upload scanned copies of required documents like IDs and tax forms.
* **Complete Workflow:** Finish the onboarding process and confirm successful completion.

**3. Code Implementation:**


```typescript
import {chromium, expect} from 'playwright';

async function automateOnboarding() {
  const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false });
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://www.adp.com/run'); // Replace with actual URL

  // Login
  await page.locator('input[name="username"]').type('your_username'); 
  await page.locator('input[name="password"]').type('your_password');
  await page.locator('button[type="submit"]').click();

  // Navigate to Onboarding
  await page.click('a[href*="/onboarding"]'); 

  // Dynamic Form Element Handling (example)
  // Locate a form field using its ID dynamically based on employee name
  const employeeName = 'John Doe';
  const firstNameInput = await page.locator(`input[name="First Name"][id="${employeeName}_FirstName"]`);
  await firstNameInput.type(employeeName);

  // Upload Documents
  // ... (Logic to select document and upload)

  // ... (Remaining parts of the onboarding process)
  
  await browser.close();
}

automateOnboarding(); 
```

**4. Step-by-Step Execution:**

1. Install Playwright: `npm install playwright`
2. Install TypeScript: `npm install -D typescript ts-node`
3. Create a typescript file (e.g., `onboarding_automation.ts`).
4. Copy and paste the code above into the typescript file.
5. **Important:** Replace `https://www.adp.com/run`, `your_username`, and `your_password` with the actual ADP RUN Onboarding URL and credentials.
6. Run the script: `ts-node onboarding_automation.ts`

**5. Pro Tips:**

* **Shadow DOM:** Use `page.locator('[...]', { shadowRoot: 'host' })` to locate elements within shadow DOM.
* **Explicit Waits:** Implement explicit waits using `page.waitForSelector()` or `page.waitForLoadState()` to ensure elements are present and ready before interacting with them.
* **Data-Driven Testing:** Leverage data files or external APIs to dynamically populate form fields and variations for testing different onboarding scenarios.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected situations or failures during automation.

**6. Practice Challenge:**

* Automate the process of uploading documents for onboarding. This may involve using `page.uploadFile()` or interacting with a specific drag-and-drop area.

**7. Next Steps:**

* Explore advanced Playwright features like screenshots, video recording, and network interception for debugging and analysis.
* Learn to use Cucumber or other test automation frameworks to write structured and maintainable test scenarios.
* Dive deeper into ADP's APIs and explore possibilities for integrating your Playwright tests with an automation pipeline for continuous integration and deployment.
