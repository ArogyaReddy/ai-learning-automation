## Lesson: Automating ADP Onboarding with Playwright 

**Learning Objective:**  Learn to automate the basic steps of an ADP Onboarding process using Playwright, automating interactions like username/password input, selecting options, and submitting forms. 

**Real-World Scenario:** Imagine you want to automate the process of onboarding a new employee in ADP. This involves setting up their profile, adding their personal information, and assigning benefits.  

**Code Implementation (TypeScript)**

```typescript
import { chromium, PlaywrightTestConfig } from 'playwright';

let browser: playwright.chromium.Browser;

async function run() {
  await chromium.launch({
    headless: false // Show the browser for debugging
  }).then(b => browser = b)

  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://www.adp.com/onboarding'); // Replace with actual ADP URL

  // Login (Adapt these selectors for your ADP system)
  await page.fill('input[name="username"]', 'your_username'); // Replace with actual username
  await page.fill('input[name="password"]', 'your_password'); // Replace with actual password
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]'); // Click the login button

  // Employee Profile Section (Modify selectors accordingly)
  await page.waitForSelector('input[name="firstName"]');
  await page.fill('input[name="firstName"]', 'John');
  await page.fill('input[name="lastName"]', 'Doe');
  // ... fill other fields like address, email, etc.

  // Benefits Selection (Adapt to your ADP system)
  await page.click('input[value="health"]'); // Example: Select Health Insurance
  // ... select other benefits 

  // Submit Form (Adapt selector)
  await page.click('button[type="submit"][value="Submit"]'); 

  await browser?.close();
}

run();
```

**Step-by-Step Execution:**

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    *   `npm install playwright`
2.  **Replace Placeholders:** Update `your_username`, `your_password`, and the CSS selectors based on the ADP system you're interacting with. Inspect the elements in your browser's developer tools to find appropriate selectors.
3.  **Run the Code:** `node your_script_name.ts`

**Pro Tips:**

* **Explicit Waits:** Use `page.waitForSelector` to ensure elements are loaded before interacting with them, preventing errors. 
* **Selectors:** Ensure your selectors are specific and reliable. Use unique attributes or combinations of attributes for targeting elements.
* **Retry Logic:** Incorporate retry mechanisms for elements that may not load immediately due to slow network conditions or complex interactions.

**Practice Challenge:**

Enhance the code to handle optional fields, error messages, and dynamically changing elements.  

**Next Steps:**

*   **Explore Advanced Playwright Features:**
    *   Page navigation
    *   Handling AJAX requests
    *   Data-driven testing
* **Integrate with CI/CD:** Incorporate Playwright testing into your continuous integration pipeline.
