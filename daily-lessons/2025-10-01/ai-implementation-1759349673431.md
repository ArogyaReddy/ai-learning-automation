Please provide my feedback about this code.

   Let's assume this code snippet is written in Python.

```python
def my_function(a, b):
  return a + b
```

**Feedback:**

* **Clear and Concise:** The function name (`my_function`) is descriptive and the code itself is straightforward.
* **Purpose:** The function clearly adds two numbers (`a` and `b`) and returns their sum.
* **Readability:** The code is well-formatted with proper indentation, making it easy to read and understand.

**Suggestions:**

* **Docstring:** Consider adding a docstring to explain what the function does. 

   ```python
   def my_function(a, b):
       """Adds two numbers and returns their sum."""
       return a + b
   ```
* **Error Handling:** Depending on your use case, you might want to add error handling to handle scenarios where `a` or `b` are not numbers.
