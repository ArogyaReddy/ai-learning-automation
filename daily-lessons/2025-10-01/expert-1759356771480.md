## Lesson: Automating ADP Onboarding with Playwright

### 1. Learning Objective

Today, you'll learn how to automate the employee onboarding process within ADP's system using Playwright, a powerful browser automation library. You'll learn to navigate the ADP interface, fill out forms, and interact with dynamic elements, laying the foundation for automating complex business workflows.

### 2. Real-World Scenario

Imagine you work as an automation architect at a large company. You need to automate the employee onboarding process within ADP, handling tasks like:

*  Navigating to the onboarding portal
*  Filling out mandatory employee information forms
*  Uploading required documents (resume, ID, etc.)
*  Creating new user accounts
*  Verifying successful completion

Automating this process saves time, reduces errors, and ensures consistency.

### 3. Code Implementation

```javascript
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

async function automateOnboarding() {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  await page.goto('https://www.adp.com/onboarding'); // Replace with your ADP URL

  // Find and fill out form fields (replace with actual element selectors)
  await page.fill('#employeeName', 'John Doe');
  await page.fill('#email', 'john.doe@example.com');
  await page.fill('#password', 'securePassword');

  // Click submit button
  await page.click('#submitBtn');

  // Handle dynamic content and potential redirects
  await page.waitForNavigation();

  // Verify successful onboarding through text or messages
  const successMessage = await page.innerText('#successMessage');
  console.log(successMessage);

  await browser.close();
}

automateOnboarding();
```

**Note:** Replace the placeholder selectors (`#employeeName`, `#email`, etc.) with the actual selectors for the elements on the ADP onboarding page. You can use Playwright's built-in inspection tools to find these selectors.

### 4. Step-by-Step Execution

1.  **Install Playwright:** `npm install playwright`
2.  **Replace placeholders:** Update the code with the correct ADP URL and element selectors.
3.  **Run the script:** `node automateOnboarding.js`

### 5. Pro Tips: Handling Dynamic Content and Shadow DOM

*   **Explicit Waits:** Use `page.waitForSelector()` to ensure elements are loaded before interacting with them.

*   **Selectors:** Master using different Playwright selectors (ID, Class, XPath, CSS) to target dynamic elements. 
*   **Shadow DOM:** If ADP uses Shadow DOM, utilize `page.getByRole()` or `page.getByTestId()` to locate elements within Shadow DOM boundaries.

### 6. Practice Challenge:

Modify the script to:

*   Upload a resume file.
*   Handle CAPTCHAs (research Playwright's CAPTCHA solving methods).
*   Take a screenshot of the completed onboarding page.

### 7. Next Steps:

*   **Robust Testing:** Implement assertions (e.g., `expect(page.innerText()).toBe('Success!')`) to ensure your automation completes successfully.
*   **Parameterization:** Make your script more flexible by taking user data as input parameters.
*   **Advanced Scenarios:** Explore Playwright's advanced features like interacting with modals, handling cookies, and working with multiple browsers.


Remember, this is just the beginning. By mastering Playwright's capabilities, you can automate a wide range of ADP processes, improving efficiency and accuracy for your organization.
