## Lesson: Automating Employee Onboarding with Playwright and ADP RUN Onboarding

**1. Learning Objective:**
By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to automate the basic steps of employee onboarding within ADP RUN Onboarding using Playwright, Javascript, and TypeScript.

**2. Real-World Scenario:**
Imagine you need to automate the process of creating a new employee profile in ADP RUN Onboarding. This includes filling out personal information, tax details, and benefits elections.

**3. Code Implementation:**

```javascript
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

async function automateOnboarding() {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  // Navigate to ADP RUN Onboarding
  await page.goto('https://www.adp.com/run-onboarding');

  // Login (replace with your actual credentials)
  await page.type('#username', 'your_username');
  await page.type('#password', 'your_password');
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');

  // Employee Profile Section
  await page.waitForSelector('#employeeFirstName'); // Wait for the element to load
  await page.type('#employeeFirstName', 'John');
  await page.type('#employeeLastName', 'Doe');
  // Fill in other personal information fields...

  // Tax Details Section
  await page.selectOption('#taxStatus', 'Single');
  // Fill in other tax details fields...

  // Benefits Elections Section
  await page.click('#benefitsCheckbox');
  // Fill in other benefits selections...

  // Submit the Form
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');

  await browser.close();
}

automateOnboarding();
```

**4. Step-by-Step Execution:**

1. Make sure you have Playwright installed:  `npm install playwright`
2. Install Î± specific browser driver (Chromium in this case): `playwright install chromium`
3. Replace the placeholder credentials in the code with your actual ADP RUN Onboarding login details.
4. Run the script: `node your_script_name.js`

**5. Pro Tips:**

* **Element Locators:** Use robust locators like unique IDs, XPath, or CSS selectors for reliable element targeting.
* **Shadow DOM Handling:**  ADP applications may use Shadow DOM. Use
`page.locator('//shadow-root/*[..my-specific-class]`, ` page.locator('svg[data-testid="myTestId"]')`
  or other advanced techniques to traverse and interact with shadow DOM elements.
* **Dynamic Content:**  If content loads dynamically, utilize async functions and `page.waitForSelector` to ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting.
* **Data-Driven Testing:** Store employee information in a JSON file and leverage it to automate onboarding for different scenarios.

* **API Integration:** Integrate Playwright with ADP APIs for more complex automation tasks like retrieving employee data or updating information.

**6. Practice Challenge:**

1.  Find the element IDs for the "Job Title" and "Department" fields in the ADP RUN Onboarding. 
2.  Modify the code to automatically fill these fields.

**7. Next Steps:**

* Explore more advanced Playwright features like using custom commands, handling alerts and prompts, and running tests within a CI/CD pipeline.
* Investigate Playwright's advanced selectors and locator strategies.
* Learn about using TypeScript for better code organization and maintainability in your automation scripts.
* Delve deeper into ADP RUN API documentation to explore automating more complex workflows like payroll processing and reporting.
