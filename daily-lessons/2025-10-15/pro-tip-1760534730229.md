## Playwright Automation Lesson: ADP Onboarding

### 1. Learning Objective

Today, you will learn how to automate the ADP RUN Onboarding process, specifically focusing on navigating to the onboarding section, selecting an employee type, and entering basic employee information. 

### 2. Real-World Scenario

You're working with a client who wants to streamline their employee onboarding process by automating the initial steps within ADP RUN. 

**Scenario:** Automate the process of creating a new employee record in ADP RUN Onboarding. This includes:

* **Navigating to the Onboarding section.**
* **Selecting "New Hire" as the employee type.**
* **Entering basic information like first name, last name, and email address.**

## 3. Code Implementation

```javascript
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

async function automateOnboarding(username, password) {
    const browser = await chromium.launch();
    const page = await browser.newPage();

    await page.goto('https://www.adp.com/login', { waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded' });

    // Login to ADP
    await page.type('input[name="username"]', username);
    await page.type('input[name="password"]', password);
    await page.click('button[type="submit"]');

    // Navigate to Onboarding
    await page.waitForSelector('a[href*="/onboarding"]', { state: 'visible' });
    await page.click('a[href*="/onboarding"]');

    // Select New Hire
    await page.waitForSelector('button[data-testid="employeeTypeNewHire"]');
    await page.click('button[data-testid="employeeTypeNewHire"]');

    // Enter Employee Information
    await page.fill('input[data-testid="firstName"]', 'John');
    await page.fill('input[data-testid="lastName"]', 'Doe');
    await page.fill('input[data-testid="email"]', 'john.doe@example.com');

    // ... Additional steps to complete onboarding process ...

    await browser.close();
}

automateOnboarding('your_username', 'your_password');
```

### 4. Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Install Playwright:** `npm install playwright`

2. **Run the code:** `node your_script_name.js` (Replace 'your_script_name.js' with your script's name)
3. **Ensure:** You replace 'your_username' and 'your_password' with your actual ADP credentials.
4. **Observe:** The script will login to ADP, navigate to Onboarding, select "New Hire," and fill in the basic employee information.

### 5. Pro Tips

* **Shadow DOM:** Pay attention to ADP's use of Shadow DOM. You might need to use specific selectors like `::shadow`: `shadow::*` or `/*[slot="something"]` to target elements within Shadow DOM.
* **Wait Strategies:** Use appropriate wait strategies like `waitForSelector`, `waitForNavigation`, or `waitForTimeout` for robust automation.

* **Error Handling:** Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected situations like failed logins or page load errors.

### 6. Practice Challenge

Modify the code to:

*   Select a specific department for the new hire from a dropdown menu.
*   Upload a sample employee file (e.g., a PDF resume).

### 7. Next Steps

*   Explore more advanced ADP RUN functionalities like managing employee benefits and payroll information.
*   Integrate your Playwright scripts into a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
*   Learn about Playwright's reporting features to generate detailed reports on automation results.


Remember to adapt this code and learning path to your specific ADP system and client requirements.
