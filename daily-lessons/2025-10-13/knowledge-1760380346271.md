## Lesson: Automating User Registration in ADP Run Onboarding

**Learning Objective:** Learn how to automate the user registration process in ADP Run Onboarding using Playwright. 

**Real-World Scenario:**

Imagine you're an HR automation expert tasked with onboarding new employees. This process involves users filling out a registration form on ADP Run Onboarding. You want to automate this process to save time and resources while ensuring consistency and accuracy. 

**Code Implementation:**

```javascript
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

async function registerNewUser(username, password, email) {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://www.adp.com/onboarding'); // Replace with actual URL

  // Locating and interacting with elements
  await page.fill('input[name="username"]', username); 
  await page.fill('input[name="password"]', password);
  await page.fill('input[name="email"]', email);

  // Submitting the form
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');

  // Verifying registration success
  const successMessage = await page.textContent('div.success-message');
  console.log(successMessage); // Print the success message

  await browser.close(); // Closing the browser instance
}

registerNewUser('john.doe@email.com', 'securePassword', 'john.doe@email.com'); 
```

 **Step-by-Step Execution:**
 1. Ensure you have Playwright installed: `npm install playwright`.
 2. Install the necessary browser drivers (Chromium in this case).
 3. Run the script: `node your_script_name.js`
 4. Replace placeholder values with actual credentials.

**Pro Tips:**
- Use Playwright's `waitForSelector` function to ensure elements are loaded before interacting with them.
- Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle potential issues during the automation process.
- Consider using environment variables to store sensitive information like credentials securely.
- Explore using Playwright's API for more complex scenarios like handling dropdowns, file uploads, etc.

**Practice Challenge:**

- Automate the process of filling out a section on the ADP Run Onboarding form, specifically the "Employment Information" section.
- Implement a mechanism to capture the user's registration confirmation email. 

**Next Steps:**


- Explore how to automate multi-step processes and handle dynamic elements.
- Learn about data-driven testing for more efficient testing of various user scenarios on ADP onboarding.
