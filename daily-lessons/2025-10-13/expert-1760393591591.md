##  Lesson: Automating ADP Onboarding with Playwright 

### 1. Learning Objective: 

Today, you'll learn to automate the navigation and data entry steps in the ADP Onboarding  process using Playwright. 

### 2. Real-World Scenario:

Imagine you need to automate onboarding a new employee in ADP RUN.  This involves creating a new employee profile, filling in their personal information, tax details, and benefits elections.

### 3. Code Implementation (JavaScript):

```javascript
const {chromium} = require('playwright');

async function automateOnboarding() {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  // Navigate to ADP Onboarding
  await page.goto('https://www.adp.com/onboarding'); // Replace with the correct URL

  // Locate and click elements for "Start New Onboarding" (Modify this selector as needed)
  await page.click('button[text="Start New Onboarding"]');

  // Fill in employee information (Modify selectors based on ADP's UI)
  await page.fill('input[name="firstName"]', 'John');
  await page.fill('input[name="lastName"]', 'Doe');
  // ... fill in other fields

  // Select benefits (Modify selectors as needed)
  await page.click('label[for="benefit-medical"]');

  // Submit the form (Modify selector as needed)
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');

  // ... further actions (e.g., verify confirmation message)

  await browser.close();
}

automateOnboarding();
```

### 4. Step-by-Step Execution:

1. **Install Playwright:** `npm install playwright`
2. **Run the code:** `node your_script_name.js`



### 5. Pro Tips: 

* **Locators:** Utilize element IDs, classes, or unique attributes for robust locators that can handle dynamic changes in the ADP UI.

* **Shadow DOM Handling** ADP might use Shadow DOM extensively.  Playwright provides methods to traverse and interact with Shadow DOM elements. Explore options like `shadowRoot.querySelector()` for targeting elements within Shadow DOM. 

* **Element Interactions:** Playwright offers methods for simulating various user interactions: typing, clicking, dropdown selections, checkbox toggling, etc.


* **Waiting:** Use `page.waitForSelector()` or `page.waitForNavigation()` to ensure elements are loaded before interacting with them. This prevents errors and improves reliability.

### 6. Practice Challenge:

Modify the script to:

1.  **Log in to ADP RUN** using valid credentials. 
2.  **Create a new employee profile:** Fill in fields for:
    - First name, Last Name
    - Address
    - Email Address
    - Phone Number
     

### 7. Next Steps:


* Explore Playwright's API  for more advanced features like:
    - Handling JavaScript alerts, modals, and popups.
    - Automating file uploads.
    - Working with complex forms and multi-step processes.
* **Learn about data-driven testing:** Inject employee data in a structured format (CSV, JSON) to automate onboarding for multiple employees simultaneously.   
* **Integration with CI/CD:** Incorporate your Playwright tests into your Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery pipeline for automated regression testing.
