## Learning Objective: 

Today, you'll learn to automate onboarding tasks within an ADP system using Playwright. We'll focus on navigating to the onboarding portal, filling out basic applicant information, and submitting the form.

## Real-World Scenario:

Imagine you're a developer tasked with automating the onboarding process for new hires at a company.  Manually inputting information into ADP for every new employee is tedious and prone to errors.  Wouldn't it be great if a script could do this for you?

## Code Implementation:

```javascript
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

async function automateOnboarding() {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  // Navigate to the ADP onboarding portal
  await page.goto('https://your-adp-onboarding-url'); // Replace with your actual URL

  // Locate and fill in the applicant information fields (example)
  await page.type('input[name="firstName"]', 'John');
  await page.type('input[name="lastName"]', 'Doe');
  await page.selectOption('select[name="country"]', 'United States');

  // Submit the onboarding form
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');

  // Add more actions as needed (e.g., verifying successful submission)

  await browser.close();
}

automateOnboarding();
```

## Step-by-Step Execution:

1. **Install Playwright:** `npm install playwright`
2. **Replace Placeholders:** Update `your-adp-onboarding-url` with the actual URL for your ADP onboarding portal. Find the specific element names within the HTML structure (e.g., `input[name="firstName"]`) using your browser's developer tools.
3. **Run the Script:** `node your-script.js`

## Pro Tips:

* **Handle Forms Dynamically:** ADP forms may use JavaScript to dynamically load fields. Use Playwright's API to wait for elements to appear before interacting with them.
* **Error Handling:** Incorporate robust error handling to gracefully handle unexpected situations during automation.
* **Screenshots:** Capture screenshots at various steps for debugging and documentation.

## Practice Challenge:

Can you automate the verification step of the onboarding process? Locate the confirmation message or element and assert that it appears on the page after successful submission.

## Next Steps:

Tomorrow, we'll explore more advanced techniques, such as:

* Automating user logins 
* Handling CSV import for employee data
* Scraping data from ADP reports
